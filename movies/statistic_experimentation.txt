Time for comparison is 2023-04-11 11:55:45.311263; 
 the better average model over past 5 versions is SVD, and 
 the superiority over other algorithm's average 5 versions is not statistically significant. 
 The better latest model is SVD. However, we choose to use SVD since difference in performance is 
not statistically significant, and this model is much smaller.
